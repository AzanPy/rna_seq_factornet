    "CONTRIBUTING.md": '''# Contributing to RNA-seq FactorNet

We love your input! We want to make contributing to RNA-seq FactorNet as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rna-seq-factornet.git
cd rna-seq-factornet

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Format code
black rna_seq_factornet/
flake8 rna_seq_factornet/
```

## Any Contributions You Make Will Be Under the MIT License

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project.

## Report Bugs Using GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/rna-seq-factornet/issues).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)

## License
